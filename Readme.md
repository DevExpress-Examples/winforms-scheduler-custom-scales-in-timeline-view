# Three discontinuous custom time scales for the Timeline view


<p>This example illustrates three discontinuous custom scales for the Timeline view which are properly aligned. The first scale is a day scale which skips Saturdays and Sundays. The second scale is an hour scale which contains only working hours from 6 to 21. The third scale with increments of 30 minutes displays hours from 6 to 21, like the second scale.<br /></p>
