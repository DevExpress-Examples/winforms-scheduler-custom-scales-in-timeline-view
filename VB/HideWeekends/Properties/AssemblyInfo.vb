' Developer Express Code Central Example:
' Three discontinuous custom time scales for the Timeline view
' 
' This example illustrates three discontinuous custom scales for the Timeline view
' which are properly aligned. The first scale is a day scale which skips Saturdays
' and Sundays. The second scale is an hour scale which contains only working hours
' from 6 to 21. The third scale with increments of 30 minutes displays hours from
' 6 to 21, like the second scale.
' Note the paint correction code which amends the
' color for the columns situated by the scale discontinuities.
